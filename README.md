## A real time service application(QR Based).

### **User Manual**

- First we'll register the user using an email and a six digit password.

- Then we'll login with that registered user (username: zixer@gmail.com, password: 123456).

- After login the QR prompt will open and then we have to scan the QR(the product details should be present in the database).

- After scanning the QR it will show the product details along with the service details and a dedicated column to add any further service details.

- The add to database button will succesfully add the updated service details in real time(that can be viewed later by scanning the product QR).
